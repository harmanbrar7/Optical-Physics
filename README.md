Investigating Optical Traps: Stiffness Determination and Correlations in Space and Time

Latex report on the results of an optical trapping experiment aimed at studying the correlation 
between trap strength and laser power, as well as the effects of Brownian motion on the behavior of 
polystyrene micro-spheres in an aqueous solution. The experiment utilized a diode laser to trap 1–5 μm polystyrene spheres, 
and their displace- ment from equilibrium positions was measured over time to determine the strength of the optical trap.
